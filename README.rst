Shapely is a BSD-licensed Python package for manipulation and analysis of
planar geometric objects. It is based on the widely deployed GEOS_ (the engine
of PostGIS_) and JTS_ (from which GEOS is ported) libraries. Shapely is not
concerned with data formats or coordinate systems, but can be readily
integrated with packages that are. For more details, see:

* Shapely manual_
* Shapely `example apps`_

Requirements
============

Shapely 1.4 requires

* Python >=2.6 (including Python 3.x)
* libgeos_c >=3.1 (3.0 and below have not been tested, YMMV)

Installation
============

Windows users should use the executable installer, which contains the required
GEOS DLL. Other users should acquire libgeos_c by any means, make sure that it
is on the system library path, and install from the Python package index.

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install shapely

Shapely is also provided by popular Python distributions like Enthought Canopy
and Continuum Analytics Anaconda. 

.. warning:: Windows users:
   do not under any circumstances use pip (or easy_install) to uninstall
   Shapely versions < 1.2.17. Due to the way Shapely used to install its GEOS
   DLL and a distribute or setuptools bug, your Python installation may be
   broken by an uninstall command. Shapely 1.2.17 will uninstall safely.

Usage
=====

Here is the canonical example of building an approximately circular patch by
buffering a point.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
  >>> patch = Point(0.0, 0.0).buffer(10.0)
  >>> patch
  <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at 0x...>
  >>> patch.area
  313.65484905459385

See the manual_ for comprehensive usage snippets and the dissolve.py and
intersect.py `example apps`_.

Integration
===========

Shapely does not read or write data files, but it can serialize and deserialize
using several well known formats and protocols. The shapely.wkb and shapely.wkt
modules provide dumpers and loaders inspired by Python's pickle module.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> from shapely.wkt import dumps, loads
  >>> dumps(loads('POINT (0 0)'))
  'POINT (0.0000000000000000 0.0000000000000000)'

All linear objects, such as the rings of a polygon (like ``patch`` above),
provide the Numpy array interface.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> np.array(patch.exterior)
  array([[  1.00000000e+01,   0.00000000e+00],
         [  9.95184727e+00,  -9.80171403e-01],
         [  9.80785280e+00,  -1.95090322e+00],
         ...
         [  1.00000000e+01,   0.00000000e+00]])

That yields a Numpy array of `[x, y]` arrays. This is not always exactly what one
wants for plotting shapes with Matplotlib (for example), so Shapely adds
a `xy` property for obtaining separate arrays of coordinate x and y values.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> x, y = patch.exterior.xy
  >>> np.array(x)
  array([  1.00000000e+01,   9.95184727e+00,   9.80785280e+00,  ...])

Numpy arrays of `[x, y]` arrays can also be adapted to Shapely linestrings.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> from shapely.geometry import LineString
  >>> LineString(np.array(patch.exterior)).length
  62.806623139095073

Numpy arrays of x and y must be transposed.

.. code-block::

  >>> LineString(np.transpose(np.array(patch.exterior.xy))).length
  62.80662313909507

Shapely can also integrate with other Python GIS packages using data modeled
after GeoJSON.

.. sourcecode:: pycon

  >>> import json
  >>> from shapely.geometry import mapping, shape
  >>> s = shape(json.loads('{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.0, 0.0]}'))
  >>> s
  <shapely.geometry.point.Point object at 0x...>
  >>> print(json.dumps(mapping(s)))
  {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.0, 0.0]}

Development and Testing
=======================

Dependencies for developing Shapely are listed in requirements-dev.txt. Cython
and Numpy are not required for production installations, only for development.
Use of a virtual environment is strongly recommended.

.. code-block:: console

  $ virtualenv .
  $ source bin/activate
  (env)$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
  (env)$ pip install -e .

We use py.test to run Shapely's suite of unittests and doctests.

.. code-block:: console

  (env)$ py.test tests

Roadmap and Maintenance
=======================

Shapely 1.2.x is a maintenance-only branch which supports Python 2.4-2.6, but
not Python 3+. There will be no new features in Shapely 1.2.x and only fixes
for major bugs.

Shapely 1.3.x is a maintenance-only branch supporting Pythons 2.7 and 3+.

"Shapely 3000" is the name of the next milestone. New features will include
vectorized operations, better integration with IPython Notebook, support for
fixed precision models, and more. Less ctypes and more Cython is another theme
in this branch. A 1.4 release should come out of this by Summer, 2014.
