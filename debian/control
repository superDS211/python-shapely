Package: python-shapely
Architecture: any
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, python (>=2.5) | python-ctypes, libgeos-c1 (>= 3.1.0)
Suggests: python-numpy, python-matplotlib
Enhances: python-numpy
Description: geometric objects, predicates, and operations
 Shapely is a package for manipulation and analysis of 2D features.
 Its capabilities include:
  * calculating the point set unions, intersections, or differences of features
  * predicate tests on features: intersects, touches, contains, and more.
 .
 Supported geometric types are points, line strings, linear rings, polygons, and
 homogeneous or heterogeneous collections thereof.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
